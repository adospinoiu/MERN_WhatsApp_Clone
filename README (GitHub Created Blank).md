#2 Installed React.js in a folder called whatsapp-clone (this will be the front end)

#4 Clean-up the default installed files (front-end) by deleting App.test.js; logo.svg and setupTests.js and then remove the appropriate imports from App.js file

#5 Remove all css from App.css file and re-margin everything in index.css

#6 On the Firebase Dashboard establish the app as a </> (webapp) under the Project Settings
